# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then created the below table to the Spotify data. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I imported the Spotify Data .csv into the table and explored the schema with the follwing quiries:


/* Which 15 artists had the hightest aveage popularity?*/
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) 
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
  GROUP BY artist_name
  ORDER BY popularity desc
  LIMIT 15;


/* Who are the top 5 most popular songs?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 5;

/*Of those songs, which one had the highest tempo?*/
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, MAX(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity desc
    LIMIT 5;
